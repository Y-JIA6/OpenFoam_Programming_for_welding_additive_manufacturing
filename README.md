OpenFoam_Programming_learning_for_welding_additive_manufacturing

Let's begin learning how to programme with OpenFoam V10 for welding and additive manufacutring

Solver 1: official laplacianFoam

Solver 2: myLaplacianFoam

Compared to solver 1, the new solver use k/Cp/rho instead of DT

Solver 3: solidLaserFoam

Add a surfical gaussian heat source to simulate laser heating effect.

Solver 4: solidLaserLatentFoam

Considering temperqture-dependent material properties 
To be continued.....
